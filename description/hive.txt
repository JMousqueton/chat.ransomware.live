Hive ransomware emerged in June 2021. Hive practices double extortion â€“ demanding payment for a decryptor, as well as for the non-release of stolen data. Hive operates as a RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service).  Hive campaigns are aggressive and rapid.  The payloads are non-stealth in their execution and full drive encryption can be achieved in just a few minutes.   Hive operators make significant use of COTS tools and LOLBins during all stages of attack.  Hive operators are also known to frequently attack healthcare and education organizations.
