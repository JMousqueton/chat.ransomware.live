				<h3>avos</h3>
                <p>AvosLocker is new ransomware that was first observed on July 4, 2021, and follows the RaaS model. The ransomware operator of the same name, avos, advertised their affiliate program on Dread and other forums to attract affiliates. Avos Locker appends the .avos extension to the encrypted files and drops the ransom note GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.TXT in every encrypted directory

				<h3>babuk</h3>
                <p>Babuk Ransomware is a sophisticated ransomware compiled for several platforms. Windows and ARM for Linux are the most used compiled versions, but ESX and a 32bit old PE executable were observed over time. as well It uses an Elliptic Curve Algorithm (Montgomery Algorithm) to build the encryption keys.

				<h3>blackmatter</h3>
                <p>First seen in July 2021, BlackMatter is ransomware-as-a-service (Raas) tool that allows  the ransomware's developers to profit from cybercriminal affiliates (i.e., BlackMatter actors) who deploy it against victims. BlackMatter is a possible rebrand of DarkSide, a RaaS which was active from September 2020 through May 2021. BlackMatter actors have attacked numerous U.S.-based organizations and have demanded ransom payments ranging from $80,000 to $15,000,000 in Bitcoin and Monero.

				<h3>conti</h3>
                <p>Conti is a ransomware that has been observed since 2020, believed to be distributed by a Russia-based group. All versions of Microsoft Windows are known to be affected. The United States government offered a reward of up to $10 million for information on the group in early May of 2022.

The software uses its own implementation of AES-256 that uses up to 32 individual logical threads, making it much faster than most ransomware. The method of delivery is not clear. 

The gang behind Conti has operated a site from which it can leak documents copied by the ransomware since 2020. The same gang has operated the Ryuk ransomware. The group is known as Wizard Spider and is based in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Once on a system it will try to delete Volume Shadow Copies. It will try to terminate a number of services using Restart Manager to ensure it can encrypt files used by them. It will disable real time monitor and uninstall the Windows Defender application. Default behaviour is to encrypt all files on local and networked Server Message Block drives, ignoring files with DLL, .exe, .sys and .lnk extensions. It is also able to target specific drives as well as individual IP addresses.

				<h3>darkside</h3>
                <p>DarkSide is a cybercriminal hacking group, believed to be based in Pakistan, that targets victims using ransomware and extortion; it is believed to be behind the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack. It is thought that they have been able to hack and extort money from around 90 companies in the USA alone. The group provides ransomware as a service.

				<h3>hive</h3>
                <p>Hive ransomware emerged in June 2021. Hive practices double extortion – demanding payment for a decryptor, as well as for the non-release of stolen data. Hive operates as a RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service).  Hive campaigns are aggressive and rapid.  The payloads are non-stealth in their execution and full drive encryption can be achieved in just a few minutes.   Hive operators make significant use of COTS tools and LOLBins during all stages of attack.  Hive operators are also known to frequently attack healthcare and education organizations.

				<h3>lockbit3.0</h3>
                <p>LockBit 3.0 was first observed around June 2022. At this time, new infections were observed, and existing LockBit 2.0 infections were upgraded to 3.0.
LockBit 3.0 operators offered an open Bug Bounty during the span of their operation.
Primary new features (from 2.0 to 3.0) include support for Zcash, updated Management capabilities, and anti-analysis and evasion.
The builder tools and source for LockBit 3.0 were “leaked” in September of 2022.

				<h3>mount-locker</h3>
                <p>According to BlackBerry, MountLocker is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), active since July 2020
The MountLocker ransomware was updated during early November 2020 to broaden the targeting of file types and evade security software.
Victim’s files are encrypted using ChaCha20, and file encryption keys are encrypted using RSA-2048.
The ransomware appears to be somewhat secure; there are no trivial weaknesses allowing for easy key recovery and decryption of data. MountLocker does however use a cryptographically insecure method for key generation that may be prone to attack.

				<h3>ranzy</h3>
                <p>Ranzy Locker is a rebrand of ThunderX, a type of malware that relied on weak encryption that was, fortunately, decrypted within a month of its launch in August 2020. ThunderX was itself a rebrand of AKO Ransomware. Ranzy Locker shares a domain used for their leak site with its two ill-fated predecessors.

				<h3>revil</h3>
                <p>As if ransomware itself wasn’t dangerous enough, a new type of attack involving ransomware is making waves in the cybersecurity community. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operations are becoming more common and more profitable for threat actors looking to launch a variety of attacks. One such operation is known as REvil, and involved a core team of threat actors offering the malware to other attackers for a price.

Although the Russian Federal Security Service claims to have dismantled REvil and charged several of the ransomware group’s members, a deeper look at this type of ransomware and RaaS can help organizations protect themselves against these types of attacks in the future.
