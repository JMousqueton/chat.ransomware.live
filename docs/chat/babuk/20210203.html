Technical support is ready to answer you<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Hello, I'm writing on behalf of [redacted]. Is this the right place to ask for information?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Hello!
 That's right, to start a dialogue, I ask you to answer 2 questions 1) 
Are you a recovery company 2) Do you have insurance against ransomware 
programs?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">1)
I'm not part of a recovery company. We are an IT company working with 
them in other fields. We just decided to give them a hand in handling 
contacts with you, since they do not have the required technical 
knowledge. 2) I have no information regarding that matter unfortunately,
 i do not know if they have insurance or not (though I'd bet they don't)<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Before
 we move on to discussing the price, upload 4-5 files of encrypted files
 no more than 10MB using any file exchanger, we will decrypt these files
 as a test<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">ok,
 I'll come back as soon as I have them, just need a moment to collect 
them. is something like a link shared via Google drive OK for you?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Ok, write to me as you are ready to provide files<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Also
 send us the ecdh_pub_k.bin file from those computers from which you 
will download files, this ecdh_pub_k.bin will be placed in% appdata%<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">ok,
 I'll be back in some minutes to tell you how much time we'll have to 
wait (i can't recover the data myself unfortunately)<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Ok<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">independent attempts without our help to decrypt files may lead to their loss, I would not advise you to do this<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">don't worry, we know how this type of issues work, we prevented them from attempting anything rush<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">ok,
 i should be able to recover 4-5 files and the related public key in a 
couple of hours. I'll text you back then. for now, thanks for the 
information<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">ok<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">You
 can find a simple archive with three files and your public key at the 
following link: https://file.io/[redacted]<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">The content is a 7z archive password-protected. The password is "[redacted]" (without quotes)<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Be careful because I fear the link will expire after one download<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">I downloaded your files, please wait<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">link will be available for 1st download https://dropmefiles.com/[redacted]<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Downloaded, received and correctly visualized the plaintext, thanks for the proof of work<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Can I move on to ask you about your demands?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Ok, now we can continue the dialogue<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">yes, 1 minets please<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">We
 know that [redacted] is a large company with an annual turnover of $ [more than two dozens] 
million a year, a price of $ 400,000 for a complete expansion of all 
systems<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">I'll 
refrain from reacting to it: I'll just tell you that such an amount is 
simply impossible to move for an Italian company. There is no way a 
company would be able to purchase that amount of coins (bitcoins or 
whatever else) in a whole year. It *might* be doable if they were like 
20, 30 thousands, but more than that seems totally impossible to me.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Anyway, I'll relay your demands to the company, I'll forward your feedback to you as soon as they answer me<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Anyway, I'll relay your demands to the company, I'll forward your feedback to you as soon as they answer me<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Thanks for your cooperation, for now<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">"I'll forward THEIR feedback to you" (typo)<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">BTW,
 I'll probably be back in some hours, since it's late evening in Italy 
and I don't think they'll answer me now. I'll be back as soon as 
possible<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">We can make a 
discount, but it must be reasonable, we will wait for comments from the 
company and we are waiting for you in this cha<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Ok, we are in touch and ready for a dialogue, and ask them about insurance<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Hi
 we talked with the company. For them the damage is 1 month of work of 4
 people and is worth 40k because have an offline backup. For you can be 
ok?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">We understand 
perfectly well that if you had backups, if you didn’t have a dialogue 
with us, we can accept. from you 100 000 usd, it will be a big discount,
 if you agree then we will move on to the deal, if you need time to 
think it over, this is your time in any case you need the decryptor, not
 me<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">they have
 ready 55k usd to close the deal and for Wednesday you'll have the money
 in your wallet. Can you agree with it?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">We understand that the company can afford to pay 100 00, we went to you for the purchase and made a big discount<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">100 000<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">I'll talk with them<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Ok, also if they have insurance, this will not incur financial losses for them at all, the insurance will pay everything<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">they don't have an insurance<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Well then, I advise you to buy it in the future.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">in italy with the italian law it's hard to cash out this amount. With difficulties we can arrive to 65k.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">We had clients from italy who could easily pay 350,000, let's stop at 85k, it will be optimal for you and us!<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">I'm talking with them. Please 5 minutes<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">ok<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">BTW
 just genuinely asking: how did they pay you such an amount? i can't 
imagine a way to move 350k from Italy in few days, it's just really 
difficult unless it happens via bank wire<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">They
 worked with the bank, we cannot tell you the company, for the reason: 
they paid, we keep secret information about our clients who made the 
transaction<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">sure,
 as I said I was just asking out of curiosity. Anyway, we convinced  
them to make an effort for 85k usd, since it's in the interest of their 
business.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Okay, do you need instructions on how to buy bitcoin? Or will you do everything yourself?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">I'll speak with them to understand how they want buy it<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">ok<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">can you give us your instruction to pay you?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">There
 are bitcoin ATMs in italy, you can use it or buy bitcoins on the 
exchange https://www.finder.com/it/how-to-buy-bitcoins, or find a 
private bitcoin broker in italy (this is the safest option) as soon as 
you are ready to transfer I will give you a wallet<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">ok do you know i can do with an atm and where i can find it and use it to give the money<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">https://coinatmradar.com/country/105/bitcoin-atm-italy/<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">ok thanks<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">we have some questions<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">1)
 is it ok for you if they proceed via coin ATM? Do you know if they can 
directly transfer funds to your wallet via the ATM, or do they need to 
purchase coins and them separately transfer them?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">2)
 once the decryption process begins, they obviously need some form of 
warranty that everything is working. As for what we could see, your 
software encrypted files, destroyed filesystem shadow copies and 
compromised backups.  What kind of technical warranty can you provide 
that everything will work smoothly even for big files (full VM disks) 
and LAN backup?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">and
 3) given that we have an agreement, could you delete the post you 
published [redacted]? this would prevent the company from having to 
move on with legal procedures, which they are legally compelled to 
follow if they have notice of a data breach. if you delete that post, 
there will no longer be any evidence, and they will be able to avoid 
this.<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">1) For ATM, you'd 
better top up your wallet and then send us 2) File size doesn't matter, 
we made all required tests before encrypt your network<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">3) post will be removed today<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">The decryptor works the same as the encryptor only in the other direction<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">ok thanks, we'll start with the work<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">During
 the day, the moderator of [redacted] will delete the topic, I wrote 
him a private message and also wrote in the topic, you can check it<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">thank you, we will get back to you soon<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">ok<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">ok thanks<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">threads [redacted] -deleted, please cheked<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Cheked, thanks! we are buying the btc. I'll ping you asap<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">hi<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Hello, when you will have required amount of bitcoin's write here<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">yes<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">You ready to pay?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">not yet, we are buying<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Okay, what date should I expect to be paid?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Wednesday please<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Okey<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Any dialogues with us only in this chat, any other email and etc contacts are invalid<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Hi, sure!<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">Hi, sure!<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">hello<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Hello, how your progress?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">We will have a call at 2 pm to understand the progress<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">i'll update you<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">okey<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">sorry only a question<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">we can decrypt file by file too?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">with your tool?<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">our tool decrypt full pc<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Unlocker decrypt full network<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">FYi we did a revolut account and tomorrow we will have the btc<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">so in the afternoom we can do it<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Well,

will be better for your safety and anonymity<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">ok thanks<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">sorry

that you can not move it to an external wallet ( out the revolut 
platform )<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">No, but I do 
not think that you will have any problems with the transfer, you should 
be able to transfer to any bitcoin wallet<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">i check now, because maybe with revolut you can send only to an revolut account<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">You will need to somehow solve this problem, and be able to transfer to any bitcoin wallet<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">yes we do<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">admin:https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinUK/comments/7gv9ia/revolut_will_not_allow_you_to_send_purchased/<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">yes we saw, we are finding a solution<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">please send us another link by mail<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-victim">to chat<br></br><i></i></p><p class="from-gang">Please
