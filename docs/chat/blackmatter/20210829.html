Timer updated.<br></br><i>01 Sep, 03:31 AM [NY time]</i></p><p class="from-victim">Thank you. Does that mean you don't obtain those .mdt requested above, and cannot provide them after payment, we would need to use the decryptor to decrypt them, correct?<br></br><i>01 Sep, 23:26 PM [NY time]</i></p><p class="from-gang">You're right.

We checked the portal a couple of days ago and this chat portal was down, I couldn't get in to chat with you. I made a request via "Contact Us" button, (Request ID: [redacted] for your reference.) And we had a long holiday weekend. Can you extend the timer again due to the portal being down?<br></br><i>06 Sep, 02:30 AM [NY time]</i></p><p class="from-victim">Also, our management wants to make sure, once the payment is make: 1) you will provide us the data back through download, 2) you will delete our data from your side and provide proof, 3) you will provide us the decryptor, with support if there is any question or issue with the decryptor), 4) you will tell us how you hacked our network, 5) you will not publish the data or the blog post / any media that you hacked our network and data. We were just able to test the decryption too now that the portal is back up. Please confirm and I will let my management know. Thank you!<br></br><i>06 Sep, 02:47 AM [NY time]</i></p><p class="from-gang">First of all we add 3more days in timer. 1. We will setup temporary onion website where you can download your files to understand which ones was downloaded. 2. We will provide shreder log-files with reports of deleted files so you will compare it with files ha you download. 3. Support for decryption available 24/7/365, but don't have any cases where it was needed. 4. Short penetration-test report with main killchain and recommendations how to prevent this in future. 5. Data in blog published only when we lost contact, so dont worry about it.<br></br><i>06 Sep, 03:13 AM [NY time]</i></p><p class="from-victim">Perfect.

We know this amount is small compared to your initial demand, but please understand that we sell [redacted] to school and government, and as you know, since covid started, all school has closed or gone online so no one has been buying our [redacted], therefore we have been suffering as many other business. Also, looking at your main page, where you mention that you do not attack government sector, if we work with school and government like that, do we qualify for the free decryptor? Just thought we'd check. Again, thank you for working with this. Please let us know if any of these works for you.<br></br><i>06 Sep, 10:28 AM [NY time]</i></p><p class="from-gang">Hello.
