Send it to me in this chat.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">After payment, the system will generate and give you a universal decryptor that will work on any device in your network.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">In this case, this incident will not be advertised in the media and, if
 necessary, in this chat you can always get technical support in case of
 problems.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Correction, file with id "readme-[redacted].txt" is required.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">this readme?<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">a few things. this is weekend and everything is closed until tuesday. 
we cannot even begin to figure out the process but there is no one to 
speak to, I see deadline of 3 days, please increase to 7-10 days to give
 us enough time to process this situation.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">can you do discount on the amount you are asking? we are in the 
Caribbean and financial systems are partially disabled due to covid.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">File 2<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I will set the timer for you until October 14, in my opinion this is 
enough to make a decision. As for the discount, I might be able to 
convince the boss to give it to you, but you ask for many extra days.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Everything is up to you, quick payment in a short period of time, implies a good relationship and conditions of redemption.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Prolonging the process only aggravates the problem.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Time added, refresh the page.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">can you accept btc? every broker we spoke to said it will take a long 
time for this amount of XMR. That is why we need time to find the right 
broker who can supply xmr.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">its the weekend and banking holiday<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I have included the possibility of payment in BTC, refresh the page.<br></br><i>17 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">can you decrypt test from another office?<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">also --- can you provide list of what data you take? or some sample? when I speak to management it will help explain.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Here is:<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Ok, we will provide you the list and any details after payment, no problem<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">+ I am the IT manager and I do not make decision about money, but I 
would like to close this soon as possible, can you provide a list of 
files or something to prove my boss that its not only decrypt?<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">What exactly do you want to see?<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Stolen [redacted] data are published in the blog in case of payment refusal or you receive a link to the files after payment.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You can show your boss the instructive stories of other companies that refused to pay the ransom.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">http://dnpscnbaix6nkwvystl3yxglz7nteicqrou3t75tpcc5532cztc46qyd.onion/<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">+ yes I show him this. But my company is in carribean there is no 
privacy law, so easier to prove to boss what listing of the files you 
take to convince. The decryptor is of secondary value to us.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I want to solve this fast too, because I did not see family for few 
days now. So anything you can do to help me when talking to boss will be
 much help.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">What proof do you need? We got access to your network, encrypted the 
data there and downloaded it, I see no point in this question, we always
 do this, these are our methods, did you see our blog? You have two 
options to get the files: after payment or publicly on the blog.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">looking for some sort of a file list if you have of our files. because 
otherwise the boss is waiting for IT to finish investigation and this 
will take long time. I want to do this faster. Can you send a list of 
the files?<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You forget that in addition to not being covered by the privacy law, 
your company is exposed to the disclosure of your internal information 
to the whole world, plus you incur reputational losses. Which client 
will want to become a premium card holder if the companie which do not 
care about their data safety?<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You asked for more days to raise funds, you got this opportunity. If 
you now want to communicate with us in an ultimatum form, then be 
prepared to get the same effect from us and complicate an already 
difficult stage of negotiations.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Now print out the whole dialogue and bring it to your boss. We can go 
back to the previous timer, after which the amount will be doubled and 
there will be no discounts. There is no one here who is going to play 
games with you, or we make a deal and you get a decryptor + link to your
 files. Or just close the dialog and do not waste your time.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I do not know if you have problem communicating in English or whether I
 am speaking to an operator with bad temper but your response is not 
smart business. Do not threaten us again, because if you make more money
 publishing information, then good for you. Otherwise, you are taking a 
possible client who is willing to pay and basically start throwing a 
tantrum like a child. I would like to speak to an adult please who can 
understand business and knows why I am asking for what I am asking.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Now, let me repeat. I am trying very hard to work with you and you need
 to understand that we understand perfectly what position you are in, 
and what position WE ARE IN. I also check your reputation and you guys 
always deliver on your promise which is great and it is a strong basis 
for a good business transaction.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Here is what I need to move this forward, it is a very simple ask. We 
need a sample of the data you take and a file list of the files you 
take. It is not difficult and it is our files anyways, so what is the 
difficulty? All this will do is prove that you are indeed in a position 
of power, and I will be able to convince my boss that we need to speak 
about payment. I am TRYING TO HELP YOU AND ME. So work with me, or ask 
your boss to put someone else to work with me. And I also ask that you 
stop threatening me, your team already do the damage, so now we can 
speak and reach agreement or you can play games of threats and verbal 
abuse. Let's pretend we are adults ok?<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">My reaction is the result of your work. I don't see before me people 
who value their business, I see attempts to study the possibility of 
mitigation of the attack. We really keep our promises, there is no need 
to doubt it. We give the decryptor, we give references to the stolen 
files, we publish the files in case of a deal failure. And now we can 
imagine that we are adults and can discuss the deal.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Understand one thing and bring it to your boss, decryptor and 
confidentiality is need not for us, but for you. Do not scare us without
 paying, there are dozens of you, it is better to concentrate on your 
problem.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">If my boss intervenes in this dialog, then it will not be 
communication, but two words and a timer per day, you are still lucky to
 deal with me, because I have time to answer you.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I am not going to enter into long correspondence and polemics anymore. 
You know the terms and conditions and they will remain unchanged.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">1. We fix the amount of the transaction after the final value is approved.
2. You pay the ransom in moneon or bitcoin.
3. After payment you get a universal decryptor for all infected computers.
4. You get a set of links that contain your files.
5. After downloading your files are deleted from our servers without the possibility of recovery.
6. No one but us will know about this incident.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You can read about Travalex, a very instructive story. They had the 
opportunity to prevent it, as a result, this error became inexcusably 
expensive for them.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">I read about you in media and bleeping computer. I have no doubt you 
will follow through and while my boss will make the business decision, I
 am trying to follow his instructions and work with you. I am asking you
 to work with me and give me what my boss is asking for. Let me further 
explain, our systems are almost back-up, but I am trying to reach common
 ground. Can you share the list of files you take? My boss does not care
 about publicity, but he does care about protecting people, if you can 
demonstrate what data you take, even just file list, it will go a long 
way in the discussion here. I am not trying to waste your time or mine, 
this will help no one. I know you are big group and you attack many 
companies and that we are just a number. I also understand you have the 
power. I am trying to be honest and explain to you what will help me 
here, this is the process I need to follow. So the question is whether 
it is possible for you to give me list of files or no. If no, I will 
tell my boss and we can figure out next steps. But let’s try to work 
together.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">At this stage of negotiations - my answer is no. The situation may 
change if we find a compromise and reach an agreement. I do the same as 
you and follow the instructions of my boss. Tonight he will get 
acquainted with the dialogue and if there are new instructions, you will
 learn about it.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">And I work with you, at your request was given +4 days, as well as 
enabled mode of bitcoins to accelerate the process of receiving funds. 
This is done first of all for you so that you can recover your systems 
faster and get back to work.<br></br><i>15 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">At this stage of negotiations - we cannot proceed unless you provide us
 with the list of files and 2-3 random sample files you took. If you 
break negotiations at this point, you are going to publish the data 
anyways, so there is zero difference between giving us the information 
or publishing. The only key difference is that if you publish instead of
 giving us the information we need, there will be zero chance of further
 negotiations. I hope your boss reconsiders his position so that we can 
finally move forward.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Ok, but in return I reduce the timer for decision making.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">http://dnpscnbaix6nkwvystl3yxglz7nteicqrou3t75tpcc5532cztc46qyd.onion/posts/[redacted]?s=[redacted]<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">This link is not yet visible to anyone except you.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">First, thank you for finally providing this information which will 
allow me to work with the boss. Second, I will certainly push to make a 
decision as fast as possible. HOWEVER - reducing the timer will not 
work. Actually because you delay the analysis for no real reason we will
 need more time. Given the amount it will not happen before Friday. You 
can try and push and you are doing a great job of that, but in a company
 that needs to follow process, it will not work and all you will do is 
end up losing this opportunity to close the issue for both side. Please 
increase the timer as we are asking. I am trying to work with you.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">We gave you enough time to make a decision. If your boss doesn't want 
to pay $6kk but wants to get off with a smaller amount, let him hurry.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">We can argue together and you can argue you gave us enough time. In a 
company that is publicly listed, 3 days is not enough time. So let's 
stop with the games here, we are trying to work with you and I have no 
interest to play games, I tell you what I need not because I feel like 
it for fun and giggles. It is also not my money, so all threats mean 
nothing. I am speaking to you because of genuine interest to solve the 
problem and make sure we conclude this successfully. If you run the 
timer and publish the conversation is over. I know you do not care 
either but I am sure we are both interested in getting this to 
successfully conclude. You took the first step in showing me what I 
needed, now do whatever you need, but I am telling you that your new 
deadline is not going to happen. Your call how we do this.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Companies that are traded on stock exchanges, solve the problem in 12 
hours, I say this because I know. I see that your actions are only aimed
 at delaying the solution of this incident.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">4 days ago you have asked for additional time to buy XMR, at now you 
write like you only now start consider payment process. Who play games? 
You already had plenty of time to make a decision and consider different
 options. Now your task is to go to the boss and come to me with the 
answer. The timer will not be moved until I get information about the 
deal.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">You decision, your rules. I will pass on your message certainly.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">and just so you know... Carribean rules because of USD embargo during 
Covid, Maybe do some research on this. Either way, you are not changing 
your position, I understand. Please understand that when timer expires 
if you publish this conversation is over and second, there will not even
 be a negotiation on price until the boss does his analysis. Thank you 
and have a wonderful day.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">Think not about the fact that we will not make a profit, think about 
the problems that will arise after publication. Have a good day, too.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-victim">Understood. It is a 2-way street my friend. We either try to work 
together or you already decide to publish etc. That is why I asked for 
the data so that I can prove to the boss that it is a serious situation.
 But it took you time, now I need the time to work on the boss.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">I do not need to be persuaded, go to the boss and come back with an answer, you have little time left.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p><p class="from-gang">You will have another day after the publication sees the world. For now there will be no link to downloads.<br></br><i>13 days ago</i></p>
