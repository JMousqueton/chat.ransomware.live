We do not have what you want.  You are asking for 60% of revenue.  You really extort companies for 60% of revenue.

I just want to get to a solution and then move to fixing our network.  <br></br><i>01.09.2022 23:53:14 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Since you are a credit organization because of our attack all your clients will stop trusting you, your business will be destroyed, this is what our pricing policy is related to, each company has an individual approach, you can never agree with me for 50 thousand dollars, if you have no more money do not write me anymore.<br></br><i>01.09.2022 23:53:22 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">If you give me something to work with, I can see what I can do here<br></br><i>01.09.2022 23:57:26 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Ask something of the director of your credit organization, whether he wants to preserve the reputation of his company or whether he better start thinking about creating a new company.<br></br><i>01.09.2022 23:59:03 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Thanks for the dialogue, I have 3 prostitutes coming to see me, I have to leave you. Have a good day.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 00:00:37 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">Well, enjoy then.  When you return, can we get to a solution. <br></br><i>02.09.2022 00:01:53 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">We want to get to a deal as quickly as possible.  After discussions with the board and reviewing our financials, we are looking to increase our offer to be between $250K to $400K.   We want to settle today so hopefully you can understand our position and we can close this deal.  For the amount within the range, we would like the decryption software, support for it, you said you had data of ours so we would like a listing of the documents and some type of deletion log to prove you no longer have it, explain how you got into our network, and to never attack us again.   We look forward to your positive response.  <br></br><i>02.09.2022 12:03:08 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">This is still not a sufficient amount, you are being brazen and clearly misleading me, but I take into account your step to meet and am also ready to give you a discount of up to $ 5.500.000.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 13:09:38 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">Not trying to be brazen nor misleading you.  I am trying to provide the facts to you that your demand amount is not realistic for a company our size and if you would work with us, we would settle this todayh <br></br><i>02.09.2022 13:12:16 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">If you had stopped lying to me and wanted to save your business then you would have stopped the ddos attack and decrypted your network in 5 minutes.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 13:15:10 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">I want to decrypt our network as quickly as possible and want to do a deal.  Your starting number is not manageable for a company of 100 employees.  If your number would have been in the $250K to $400K range, we would have paid you right away.  <br></br><i>02.09.2022 13:19:04 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">so let's talk about paying you right away.  Can we get a reasonable number so you can go enjoy your weekend<br></br><i>02.09.2022 13:19:44 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">In connection with a ddos attack you try to change the source code of your website and the entire authorization page including post data, this will not help you, you open new vulnerabilities that will allow other hackers to easily download all the data from your website, thus you only make yourself worse, once your customers' data is published you can forget about your business, no one will ever trust you. Stop, don't make a stupid step, your assets are more than 300 million dollars, your director will not get poorer if he pays me 5.500.000. Do not be greedy, save your priceless reputation and business, in banking there is nothing more valuable than a reputation, your reputation you have earned over many years and lose in an instant.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 13:19:50 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">can you proivde the partial file tree while I caucus with my board members<br></br><i>02.09.2022 13:35:52 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">It will take some time, yes I can do it if you are willing to wait.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 13:49:44 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">As a credit union, we are a not for profit and the number your reference in not our money.  We hold money for indivuduals in their accounts in their name. We cannot use this money. <br></br><i>02.09.2022 16:24:09 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Then let this organization know that it's time to take your money, your time is up.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 17:52:23 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">The best I can do for you is 5 million<br></br><i>02.09.2022 17:54:52 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Voice your decision, it's time to publish your data.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 17:55:33 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">I don't know what you mean by our time is up but we are negotiating in good faith.  Our board is willing increase it's offer range to $650K - $750K which we can pay quickly. Publishing our data does no good.  We are here trying to resolve this.  You think we have more money than we have and we have asked you to consider we are a not for profit credit union and the assets you reference are not ours.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 18:04:55 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Tell your board that the price will not go below 5 million, please give me their answer as soon as possible.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 18:06:22 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">I also negotiate in good faith, but I can't do it forever; my time is very expensive. When I see that negotiations are deadlocked and you do not hear me, there is no point in continuing negotiations. We are not in the Arab market to bargain here for 100-200 thousand dollars. You and I have serious businesses, we earn millions of dollars, the reputation of your business is priceless and can not be worth less than 5 million, if your leadership is adequate and understands that the business had to close, they will pay 5 million, if you are willing to close your business, enjoy your 5 million and do not pay me.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 18:08:50 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">We are under 100 person firm.  The assets you reference are not ours.  If you are financially motivated we have given you a reasonable offer and most victims on your blog have amounts fall smaller than the amount you want and are larger organizations.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 18:26:31 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">The amount of ransom is always individual and depends on different factors, annual income, profit, quality of network encryption, quantity of stolen data, quality of stolen data, availability of dirt, violations of the law and more. In my blog there is no credit organization that gives loans to people, what do you think is the reason for this?<br></br><i>02.09.2022 18:28:43 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">I'm going for a boat ride soon, if you want to close the deal right now let me know back soon. Thank you.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 18:56:32 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">We want a deal as well but remind you we only hold money and it's not ours to use under any circumstance by law.  The money that is ours cannot be used for non-banking expenses by law and what is left over after that is very little.  We simply don't have the amount of money you demand but have offerred you a tremendous amount of money.  Take this deal and let's end this.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 18:59:49 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">I cannot accept your amount. I'm sorry.<br></br><i>02.09.2022 19:45:16 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">We are here when you want to do a deal.

Your wallet is likely held at some brokerage firm. The brokerage firm cannot access your wallet and take that money. They are just holding the money and you are the one that controls it not us. When we report to our regulator, we must report the amount of funds we are holding.  Again – this is loans and deposits that we cannot use and is reported to regulators. We are offering you 25% of our Net Revenue Number of $3million. $750,000 is a sizeable sum. We want to get to a deal and will pay you quickly. So, hopefully you understand that we do not control the $500,000,000 number as it controlled by our members. We only can control the $3 Million Net Revenue Number and we are offering 25% of that sum.  I do not know if other organizations are giving you this amount of their Net Revenue.
