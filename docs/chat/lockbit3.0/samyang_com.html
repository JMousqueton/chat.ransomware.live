My Client is an IT service company, so do you have any information about the company my client provides? Isn't it saying that sales are $1B? I'm also acting as an agent in the middle, so I don't know what they're discussing I don't know exactly what they’re discussing, and they just say that they need more time<br></br><i>01.08.2022 09:15:07 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">They're bluffing.<br></br><i>01.08.2022 16:49:38 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Apparently the reputation of your company and the value of the stock on the stock exchange are of no value to your client since he is behaving this way.<br></br><i>01.08.2022 16:50:41 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">What did we do? I don't know what you mean.<br></br><i>02.08.2022 06:43:39 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">We are doing our best to negotiate in the middle.

I'll try to convince our client as soon as possible<br></br><i>02.08.2022 15:57:52 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">My client is not lying. There's something you need to know exactly<br></br><i>03.08.2022 02:06:23 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">The company you hacked is an IT service company, and the information you have on the server is the customer’s(of my client) information.<br></br><i>03.08.2022 02:08:40 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">The $10B Revenue you're talking about is the Revenue of customers(of my client).<br></br><i>03.08.2022 02:10:02 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">you hacked my client’s revenue was $70M and the profit was $4M last year. The client you hacked cannot afford to pay $18M.<br></br><i>03.08.2022 02:11:38 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">So the client confessed to the customer and is discussing the hacking. This complicated process delays the answer. You should understand this situation<br></br><i>03.08.2022 02:13:34 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">I think the hacked IT service company will probably offer around $500,000 at the outset<br></br><i>03.08.2022 02:18:39 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">The fact that we hacked your client's company through the IT company that serviced him does not mean that the ransom price should be less, your IT company is not interesting to us, we need the big fish, your client.<br></br><i>03.08.2022 22:14:46 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">I fully understand that you need Big Fish.<br></br><i>04.08.2022 05:54:50 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">Big fish is very angry with IT service company. Because IT service company was hacked and Big fish’s information was leaked, Big Fish is saying that IT Company should pay for everything. Also If this doesn't be solved, I heard that Big Fish will cut the deal with the IT company and fill a damage compensation lawsuit.<br></br><i>04.08.2022 05:55:54 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">I will explain again because you still don't seem to understand the current situation clearly. My client is an IT service company. You hacked through this IT service company and had Big Fish's information.<br></br><i>04.08.2022 05:57:50 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">I will explain again because you still don't seem to understand the current situation clearly. My client is an IT service company. You hacked through this IT service company and had Big Fish's information.<br></br><i>04.08.2022 05:58:53 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">However, IT service company cannot afford to pay $18M, as I said before. In the previous conversation, I said that IT service company would pay $500,000. Bur now IT service company seem willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for resolution. And that's big amount(one-third of the client's one-year profit)<br></br><i>04.08.2022 06:01:29 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">Please understand the above situation accurately and give me an answer.<br></br><i>04.08.2022 06:03:27 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">I understand that your job as a negotiator is to get the ransom price as low as possible, you are a good negotiator, but in this case you are offering too small an amount for a very large company, the damage we can do to your client is absolutely incomparable to the amount you are offering. It doesn't matter who wins your lawsuit, we are now talking about saving a lot more in lost profits for your client, your client would be much better off paying us the ransom and then suing the IT company and recovering the damages. The company's stock could collapse so badly that your client would lose hundreds of millions of dollars instead of just $18 million. I appreciate the increase in buyout amount from your side and see it as a desire to make a good deal for both of us, but 1 million is absolutely not enough for a company with annual revenues of 10 billion dollars. At the same time to show respect to you as a brilliant negotiator I am ready to make a discount of 3 million dollars, in this way I am ready to completely remove all your stolen data, provide decryption keys, and forget about the fact that you have ever been attacked, our deal will be an absolute secret and no one will ever know about it. It's up to you.<br></br><i>04.08.2022 19:06:04 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">The bottom line is that if you pay me 15 million dollars in 3 days, everyone will be happy.<br></br><i>04.08.2022 19:06:51 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">With this level of hacking skills, you must be very smart and logical people. It seems that we need logical conversations, not emotional ones.<br></br><i>05.08.2022 10:09:12 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">I understand that you reasonably present the required amount depending on the size of the company's revenue Bigfish's revenue is about $2B, not $10B And Big fish's profit is much less than this. The amount you ask for is a very difficult amount to pay for even Big fish. If you need to check Big Fish's sales and profits, you can check it right away by entering the stock site. If necessary, I will send financial statements disclosed on the securities site<br></br><i>05.08.2022 10:11:31 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">I think negotiations can proceed only when the required amount is presented again.  I look forward to a positive answer.<br></br><i>05.08.2022 10:12:42 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">I am not emotional. I would be happy to see financial documents that you can show me.<br></br><i>05.08.2022 10:17:43 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">I can't contact you because it's the weekend now. I will contact you on Monday.<br></br><i>06.08.2022 04:43:19 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Ok<br></br><i>06.08.2022 11:16:16 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">I send you the sales volume of the big fish that I checked directly on the Google Securities site.<br></br><i>08.08.2022 03:44:44 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">In terms of $, last year's sales volume is about $1.8B. The reason why you check the exact sales volume of Big fish is because I think it's to reasonably adjust the required amount.<br></br><i>08.08.2022 03:46:04 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">File: [매출자료.png]<br></br><i>08.08.2022 03:46:53 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Where net profit?<br></br><i>08.08.2022 03:50:46 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">Net Income last year was about $30M on a $ basis.
