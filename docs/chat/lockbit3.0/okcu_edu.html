What did you decide?!<br></br><i>01.08.2022 09:06:24 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">When will you pay?<br></br><i>01.08.2022 16:28:48 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">How are we suppose to get $1M? That isn't a fair amount here, it's not reasonable on our end. Our revenue doesn't reflect the amount of cash we have access to. Can you go to your boss and see if their is a discount?<br></br><i>01.08.2022 22:18:19 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">I'm the boss. Pay! The price is not determined by chance, we have deliberately approved the redemption amount, and it is not discussed.<br></br><i>01.08.2022 23:33:22 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">You ask us for a discount, but don't tell us how much you're willing to pay.

We went to the bank with your $1M demand and they pretty much laughed in our faces. They want us to come back on Monday with a lower number. We haven't offered anything because we truly don't know how much we can get in total. What is the biggest discount you can give us based on that and what we have said to you in the past? You seem to be in a rush here so let's please help each other.<br></br><i>03.08.2022 21:51:55 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">There is no minimum and maximum discount. Start with how much money you're willing to pay! If our negotiations drag on, we will speed them up with the publication of a post about the attack.<br></br><i>03.08.2022 21:57:14 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">And if you're also inactively carrying out negotiations, we can also speed them up by publishing them! Or doubling the price! Don't play games with us, we don't like it<br></br><i>03.08.2022 21:58:44 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">It's in your best interest to bring active negotiations and prevent publication in the first place! So far, you're doing the opposite.<br></br><i>03.08.2022 22:00:58 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">If payment is not received by the end of the week, we will publish a post on our blog!<br></br><i>04.08.2022 01:05:07 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">By the end of the week is when you want payment?! Based on how this is going no payment will be made if you publish our data tomorrow. The board has decided, as a whole, that we won't be paying anything if our name ends up on your blog. We've been working with you this whole time to make some progress so let's please not start making threats. At the top of the chat, it says we still have 16 days left. Please work with us not against us here.<br></br><i>04.08.2022 18:47:27 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Throughout the negotiations, we did not come to anything! A post will be published tomorrow as a timer, not the data. You negotiate for a very long time and not productively. You don't even try to negotiate a price, and you don't pay the price of the descript and deletion of the data! Speaking of the date at the top of the chat, after 16 days your decryptor will be deleted and you will never decrypt your data. And the stolen data will also be published! Keep in mind, these aren't just threats, we're keeping our promises.<br></br><i>04.08.2022 19:52:29 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">When will you pay?<br></br><i>04.08.2022 22:40:23 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">We're waiting to hear from the bank, we're hoping they will be able to help us out here. Please remain calm, we want this over with as much as you do. I'm not sure what they will think of all this. So please, do not publish anything, not even our name tomorrow or else my boss won't want to pay anything. We need to see what the bank says about a loan as we don't have anything close to your demand on hand. If it were up to me you'd already have your money, but there are other factors in play here. It's not just a one man operation, similar to yours. We will give you an update after we hear from the bank. We're hoping they will give us an answer Monday. I'm sorry but not all the decisions are up to me.<br></br><i>05.08.2022 18:05:35 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">ok<br></br><i>05.08.2022 18:19:56 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Ok, we'll wait until Monday.<br></br><i>05.08.2022 20:43:23 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">???<br></br><i>08.08.2022 22:12:51 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">If today we do not hear from you a profitable offer - we will reveal the attack<br></br><i>09.08.2022 10:05:23 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">Hello, sorry for the delay. We got some responses and our meeting is happening tonight. We will be able to get you an decent offer tomorrow, so please keep an eye out for our response then.<br></br><i>09.08.2022 20:52:29 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">OK. If this does not happen, the post will be published<br></br><i>09.08.2022 20:59:54 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Please pay attention to the date above the chat. On this day, your decryptor will be deleted and data recovery will be impossible!<br></br><i>10.08.2022 11:54:05 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">We are here. We apologize for not giving you an update yesterday but we already short staffed and could not make to the chat. Please do not reveal anything related to the attack to the public. We're working and juggling a lot to get everyone to get on board with a payment here. It has been tough for us to scramble funds together, but at this moment we have $25k on hand that we can send your way. Unfortunately the bank never got back to us about a loan amount, so we're still waiting to see if they will give us any amount. They aren't too happy about sending money to hackers. Is this something you would make a profit from? How much does it cost you to hack a company?<br></br><i>10.08.2022 15:57:55 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Do you seriously think that this is a decent amount? Is your data worth 25k? Our patience snapped. Wait for the blog post!<br></br><i>10.08.2022 18:07:33 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">$25K is what we have right now. We're just letting you know and trying to be transparent with you. Can you come down on your demand at all? This would help me convince some people to try and get more money. It would also show everyone that you're willing to work with us. We're not trying to upset you here, that's not our intention. Any post about us and we won't get approval to pay any amount so let's please work together.<br></br><i>10.08.2022 18:24:16 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">We have already listened enough to your empty words. Post published<br></br><i>10.08.2022 18:32:18 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Why do you go to the chat? You said you wouldn't pay if the post ended up on a blog. So what is the purpose of the visit?<br></br><i>12.08.2022 17:46:25 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">?<br></br><i>15.08.2022 16:40:10 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Have you looked at the stolen data?<br></br><i>22.08.2022 11:23:34 UTC</i></p>
