We told you that on January 15 our decryptor will stop working and your servers will remain encrypted forever. We didn't promise you anything about a price increase. Your employees made a mistake - the price is not 350.000 but 250.000 and will increase every two days. The next increase of 50,000 will be January 9. This is payment for your slowness. And on January 15 we will begin to publish your confidential information on the shadow forums, as well as send it to your clients, competitors and regulatory agencies in the United States.

No need to play with us. You have a deadline of January 15. Then we publish and send your data everywhere we can (and we can do a lot). Change the recovery, or pay the final price of $250,000 by January 15.<br></br><i>10.01.2023 19:07:23 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">We are starting to publish and distribute data.<br></br><i>03.02.2023 14:39:37 UTC</i></p><p class="from-victim">Hello.

What are your suggestions and options?<br></br><i>13.02.2023 21:28:59 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Also recall that the spreading of correspondence is punishable by huge fines, as well as administrative penalties up to the liquidation of the company. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act<br></br><i>13.02.2023 21:43:42 UTC</i></p><p class="from-gang">Hello. Since you are a new person, we will repeat it again for you. We have a huge number of critical files for you. Even a small number of your files will not only put an end to your business and the career of your employees, but will also lead to a large number of lawsuits for the distribution of confidential information of your customers and partners. A bonus for you will be sending all of your documentation (including accounting) - to the relevant regulatory agencies, which will be interested in the fact of the spread of your critical data, and someone may want to take the chance and improve their career. You understand that the law in any country is an extremely subjective thing, which can be turned either in your direction or against you. We have not published your data just because we have a lot of work to do right now, and we are very creative in spreading client information - we want as many people connected with you as possible to know that you have allowed a situation where their finances and safety are in danger due to your fault. We are attaching some screenshots of the most interesting, from our point of view, files. This is not everything, just a small part of what we have.

This is the Lockbit team.  We see that you relaxed and thought that we had forgotten about you?  Don't worry - we have enough time and energy for everyone.  Your data is quite interesting because you did all the work for us. For example, the Active Clients folder in the Scanned Client Info folder is just ready to be delivered to your clients, don't you think?  How will your life and financial well-being (not to mention your reputation and credibility) change when all the documents are in the public domain?  Let's not hide it - we have partners who would love to buy all your data from us. But we want to help you first and save, first of all, the fate of you and your employees. It's not very pleasant to find yourself on the street with huge debts from lawsuits and to be blacklisted by employees who allowed leaks and damage to the businesses of partners who trusted you.  You still have the option to settle with us, and we are committed to removing all of your files and pointing out cybersecurity issues.
