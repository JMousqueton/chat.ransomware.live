Or We should continue attacks ?<br></br><i>16 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-victim">We are still reviewing the information. We only found out about the 
$600,000 price. Our intention is not to push this to the side, but we 
need some time to figure out what we can afford. This is the first time 
we are dealing with this type of issue.<br></br><i>16 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-gang">Whats your offer?<br></br><i>16 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-gang">I know your resources very well, after your offer i will explain you what is what<br></br><i>16 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-victim">We have a meeting set for tomorrow morning to discuss finances.

 a tough year for us and we're a tiny company. We hope you can see that.
 Based on a few loans we received, we can pay you $110,000. If this 
price is not suitable, then we'll need to look at outside sources for 
cash. We're a small shop and don't have access to easy funding.<br></br><i>15 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-gang">Then if your business doesnt gaving you profit, you should think about - close business like this.<br></br><i>15 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-gang">We can do our best, give you some discount, but not big like you want<br></br><i>15 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-victim">We just need a price we can afford. What type of discount can you give us?<br></br><i>15 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-gang">10%.<br></br><i>15 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-victim">So $540,000?<br></br><i>15 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-victim">If that's the case, then we really have a lot of work to do here. We can't take on so much debt considering our size.<br></br><i>15 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-victim">Are there any other files you can provide us so that we have more bargaining power with lenders?<br></br><i>15 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-gang">We have already given files and a good discount.<br></br><i>15 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-victim">You're asking 5x more than what we can afford to pay. We're putting 
ourselves on the line and potentially in more debt as we speak with 
lenders. We can't take all this on if we don't know what we're paying 
for. All we need is some help from you.<br></br><i>15 days  ago,</i></p><p class="from-gang">Last evidence pack, other requests will be regarded as a waste of our time.
